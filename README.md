# MW2 Killstreaks Tweaks/Balances/Fixes

### Various changes to the killstreaks gsc files to tweak and balance them and fix bugs

```TODO: This list is not complete```
#### _airdrop.gsc
* Littlebird has miniguns and will shoot 2 RPGs
* Emergency Airdrop will fire AC130 weapons as it flies over

#### _autosentry.gsc
* Sentry lasts much longer
* Sentry will shoot RPGs at players
* Sentry will shoot Stingers at flying killstreaks

#### _emp.gsc
* EMP replaced with very agressive AI Controlled Littlebird  (still 15 kills)
* LB will hunt and look at enemy players firing miniguns and RPGs
* LB will hunt and look at flying killstreaks firing stingers

### _harrier.gsc
* Very minor tweaks to harrier targetting of players (mostly bug fixes where harrier locks onto distant target too long)
* Harrier is more defensive than offensive (more likely to stay put at defense location vs hunting players across the map)
* Harrier will target other flying killstreaks (ie enemy harriers) with it's missiles
* Harrier will leave if their owners dies

### _helicopter.gsc
* Allow more than one helicopter in the air at at time
* Attack Helicopter fires a few more bullets per round to actually kill it's target
* Attack Helicopter slightly more accurate
* Attack Helicopter will look at target
* Pavelow will coin toss and use attack areas if avaliable instead of loop paths
* Chopper Gunner has RPGs/Stingers
* Chopper Gunner minor changes to target highlighting
* Chopper Gunner starts one node closer
* CHopper Gunner uses different hunting behavior than loop paths if attack areas not avaliable
* All Helicopters will fly above buildings when leaving (very immersion breaking to see choppers fly thru buildings)
* All Helicopters will fly a bit lower on most maps and much lower on specific maps
* All Helicopters will leave if their owner dies
